    <summary>What is this?</summary>
    This app will teach you English Braille. Every braille symbol has a corresponding representation in text. You will
    be presented either a braille symbol, or its text equivalent. You can click on it, to 'flip' and see the
    corresponding alternative representation. If you already knew that pairing, click the ✅, otherwise click the ❌. You
    will then be presented a new symbol or text representation. The app will remember which ones you got right and which
    ones you got wrong. Over time you will be presented with the ones you get wrong more often, until gradually you
    learn them all.
