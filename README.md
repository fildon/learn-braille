# Learn Braille

A simple flashcard webapp for learning braille.

Hosted at [fildon.me/learn-braille](https://fildon.me/learn-braille/)

## Developing

Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Build the project:

```shell
npm run build
```

Serve the project locally:

```shell
npx serve dist
```

You can also test and lint with `npm run test` and `npm run lint` respectively.

This project enforces a 100% test coverage policy, with concessions made for the [imperative shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell) only.

## TODO

- Sharing preview images
- Favicon
- More state surfaced in UI
